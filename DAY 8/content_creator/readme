Agentic AI Content Generator
This project implements a multi-agent system for generating and refining content on Agentic AI using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. It simulates a collaborative workflow where specialized AI agents work together to produce a high-quality markdown report on Agentic AI, following a reflection-based agentic pattern.

Project Overview
The system consists of two primary agents: a Content Creator Agent that drafts content on Agentic AI and a Content Critic Agent that evaluates the draft for language clarity and technical accuracy. The agents iterate over a maximum of three turns to refine the content, ensuring clarity, accuracy, and professionalism. The final output is a polished markdown document explaining Agentic AI concepts.
