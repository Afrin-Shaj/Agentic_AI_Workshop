Multi-Agent EDA System with AutoGen
This project implements a sophisticated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) system using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. It leverages multiple specialized AI agents to automate and streamline the EDA workflow, producing a comprehensive, high-quality report on the Iris dataset (or any provided dataset).
🌟 Project Overview
The system coordinates six specialized agents to handle distinct EDA tasks: data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, report generation, quality assurance, and code validation. Using AutoGen, the agents collaborate in a structured workflow, incorporating feedback to ensure accuracy and clarity. The final output is a professional markdown report with insights, visualizations, and actionable recommendations.
